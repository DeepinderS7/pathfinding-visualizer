# Pathfinding Visualizer

**Description**:
This project is an interactive **Pathfinding Visualizer** built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Context API**. It demonstrates various pathfinding algorithms (like Dijkstraâ€™s, A\*, and BFS) by visualizing them in real-time.

## Features

- **Visualizes pathfinding algorithms**: Dijkstra's, A\*, and BFS.
- Interactive grid where users can place start, end points, and obstacles.
- **Real-time visualization** with smooth animations.
- Built using **TypeScript** for type safety and scalability.
